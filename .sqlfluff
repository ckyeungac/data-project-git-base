# L011 - We don't always alias tables with AS ("FROM table1 AS tb1" instead of "FROM table1 tb1"). Do for columns but not for tables.
# L026 - BigQuery uses STRUCTS which can look like incorrect table references
# L027 - Asks for qualified columns for ambiguous ones, but we not qualify our columns, and they are not really ambiguous (or BigQuery would complain)
# L028 - Insists on references in column names even if not ambiguous. Bit OTT.
# L030 - Function names will be mixed case so don't enforce case
# L031 - Avoid aliases in from and join - why?
# L032 - Uses joins instead of USING - why?
# L034 - Insists on wildcards (*) in certain SELECT order - why?
# L035 - Do not use ELSE NULL as redundant. But it's clearer!?
# L036 - Select targets should be on new lines but sub clauses don't always obey this. Maybe revisit in future?
# L043 - Use COALESCE instead of CASE if you can. But it's clearer!?
# L060 - Use COALESCE instead of IFNULL or NVL. We think ISNULL is clearer.

# Some rules can be configured directly from the config common to other rules.
